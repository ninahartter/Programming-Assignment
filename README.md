# Programming-Assignment
Here you can find my Assignment.
I chose number 1) Scrambled Text.


If you have cloned my program, you can run it and it will do some testing of the functions itself. However, you can test it further by running the individual functions:

- reorder_middle()
- reorder_complete()
- reorder_size()
- random_upper_lower()
- backwards(): an additional function, which returns a string with each word spelled backwards.
